This is where i started my Portfolio when taking my DSA Project

# **Amazon Product Sales Analysis**  
**Project:** Pricing, Discounts & Customer Reviews Analysis  
**Tools:** Microsoft Excel (PivotTablest, Data Visualization)  
**Dataset:** Amazon Electronics (Cables, Electronics, Computer& Accessories)

## **1. Project Overview**  
### **Objective**  
Analyzed Amazon product data to identify pricing trends, discount effectiveness, and customer satisfaction across categories to support strategic decision-making.

### **Key Business Questions**  
- How do discounts vary by product category, and which segments offer the deepest markdowns?
- Which categories have the highest customer ratings, and how do they correlate with pricing?
- What is the revenue potential (price Ã— engagement) of top-performing products?
- How are products distributed across price ranges, and where is demand concentrated?

## **2. Data Preparation & Cleaning**  
### **Approach**  
ðŸ”¹ **Removed Duplicates:** Ensured data integrity by eliminating duplicate entries (`Data â†’ Remove Duplicates`).  
ðŸ”¹ **Handled Missing Values:** Replaced blank ratings with zeros to maintain accurate averages (`=IF(ISBLANK(), 0)`).  
ðŸ”¹ **Standardized Data:**  
   - Corrected inconsistent naming (e.g., "Electornics" â†’ "Electronics") using `=PROPER()`.  
   - Converted discount percentages to decimals for calculations (e.g., "64%" â†’ `0.64`).  
ðŸ”¹ **Validated Numerical Fields:** Flagged pricing outliers with Conditional Formatting to ensure data reliability.

## **3. Analytical Techniques**
